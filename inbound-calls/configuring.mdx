An "Inbound Assistant" is simply an AI assistant set to **inbound** mode. Key steps:

1. **Prompt & Voice**

   - Provide a clear system prompt. Example:  
     _"You are the Support Bot for Acme Inc. Greet politely, ask for the customer's need, and attempt to answer basic FAQs."_
   - Choose a voice from the built-in library or a cloned voice.

2. **Initial Message**

   - The first line of dialogue once the AI picks up.
   - Example: _"Hi, thank you for calling Acme Inc. How may I help you?"_

3. **Add Tools (Optional)**

   - **Transfer**: If the caller needs a human agent.
   - **End Call**: Condition to end the call politely.
   - **Appointment Scheduler**: If you want them to book a slot on your calendar.

4. **Call Flow**

   - In the system prompt, mention potential dialogues, e.g., "If they mention billing, ask for their invoice number."

5. **Save & Test**
   - Dial the inbound number from your cell phone.
   - Confirm the AI greets and responds according to your instructions.

**Tip:** Revisit your assistant's settings regularly to improve the conversation flowâ€”especially if you see frequent hang-ups or missed info.
