If you haven't already, check out our [Phone Numbers](../../phone-numbers/types-of-phone-numbers.md) section to learn how to obtain or integrate a number. Once you have a number:

1. **Assign It to Your AI Assistant**

   - Go to **Assistants** > **(Your Inbound Assistant)**.
   - Under **Phone Number**, pick the number you want to use.

2. **Verify Functionality**

   - Test by calling the number from an external phone.
   - The AI should answer with your configured greeting.

3. **Monitoring Inbound Lines**
   - In the **Phone Numbers** page, you can see active lines, monthly cost, and usage.
   - Release lines you no longer need to avoid extra rental fees.

## Handling Country-Specific Requirements

Some regions may require:

- **Local address or business registration**
- **ID documents** for toll-free or special lines

If so, you'll be prompted to upload documents for **custom provisioning** before your number is activated.
