After an inbound call, Otonistark.ai provides transcripts, analytics, and possible automation triggers.

## 1. Recording & Transcription

- **Recording**: Typically saved in the call logs, so you can replay.
- **Transcription**: The AI's recognized text, which is used to generate its responses.

## 2. Post-Call Data (Summary & Extracted Variables)

- The AI can store or forward call info (e.g., name, reason for calling) to a connected CRM or spreadsheet.
- Summaries may include "intent" or "call outcome."

## 3. Automation Triggers

- Using the built-in no-code platform, you can do things like:
  1. **Email or Slack** the transcript to your team.
  2. **Log** the call outcome in Google Sheets.
  3. **Notify** a human agent if follow-up is needed.

## 4. Viewing Insights

- In your Otonistark.ai dashboard, go to **Calls** or **History**.
  - Filter by inbound calls.
  - Click a specific call to see the transcript, recording, or final notes.

**Note:** For advanced analytics (like call sentiment or deeper classification), watch out for upcoming features or use the webhook/API to feed transcripts into external tools.
