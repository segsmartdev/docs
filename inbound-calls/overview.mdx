When someone dials your dedicated (or SIP-integrated) number, Otonistark.ai can answer automatically through an AI Assistant. This section covers the big-picture flow of inbound calling:

1. **Caller Dials Your Number**

   - A local, international, or toll-free line assigned to your AI assistant.

2. **AI Assistant Answers**

   - Greets the caller using your configured voice and initial message.
   - Follows the **system prompt** to handle inquiries or gather information.

3. **Optional Actions**

   - Transfer to a human operator (if configured).
   - Schedule appointments, check order statuses, or collect data for later use.

4. **Call Completion**
   - AI ends the call politely or transfers to a queue/agent if needed.
   - You get transcripts and call analytics afterward.

**Tip:** Start by renting or provisioning a phone number and linking it to an inbound-type AI Assistant.
