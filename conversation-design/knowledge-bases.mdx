For more advanced usage, you may want the AI to reference detailed FAQs or documents. Below are current approaches:

## 1. Copy-Paste into Prompt

- **Pros**: Quick to set up.
- **Cons**: Large texts can slow down responses or risk partial "hallucination."
- **Usage**: Useful for short references, like top 10 FAQs.

## 2. Knowledge-Base Feature

- Otonistark.ai plans to introduce a dedicated "Knowledge Base" or doc upload feature.
- This would let you store PDFs or text docs that the AI can query on demand.
- This feature is currently in development and will be available soon. **However, you can contact our support team and send us your documents to manually embed them.**

## 3. Best Practices

- Keep info concise, use bullet points.
- Separate topics with clear headings so the AI can parse more effectively.
- Monitor call transcripts to confirm the AI references your data correctly.

**Note:** If you have an urgent need for large doc integration, contact our support about possible custom solutions or partial "manual" embeddings.
