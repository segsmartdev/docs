Phone conversations can be messyâ€”callers may interrupt the AI or have background noise. Otonistark.ai provides **voice activity detection** and **speech settings** to handle these situations.

## 1. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

- **What It Is**: A setting that helps the AI wait for the user to finish talking before responding.
- **Configuration**: In the assistant's advanced settings, you can enable or disable VAD.
  - _High Sensitivity_: AI might interrupt less, but could lead to awkward pauses.
  - _Low Sensitivity_: AI might talk over the user if they pause mid-sentence.

## 2. Speech Speed & Filler Usage

- **Speech Speed**: Some voices allow you to slow down or speed up how quickly the AI talks.
- **Filler Usage**: Decide if the AI uses "umm," "uhh," or short "mhm" acknowledgments to sound more natural.

## 3. Interruptions

- If a user starts speaking while the AI is talking, the AI can attempt to stop and listen. However, perfect interruption handling can't be guaranteed due to phone audio overlap.
- Encourage shorter AI responses in your prompt to reduce collision with the caller's speech.

**Tip:** Conduct test calls to find the right balance of sensitivity and speed. Overly fast responses or overly long monologues can frustrate callers.
