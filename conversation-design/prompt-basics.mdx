Otonistark.ai uses a **System Prompt** to guide how your AI assistant interacts with callers. Crafting an effective prompt is key to smoother, more accurate phone conversations.

## 1. System Prompt vs. Initial Message

- **System Prompt**: Overall instructions and context. Example:  
  _"You are the Support Bot for TechMasters Inc. Greet politely, ask for a name, handle basic troubleshooting, and transfer the call if the issue is complex."_

- **Initial Message**: The first thing the AI says, especially for inbound. Example:  
  _"Thank you for calling TechMasters! How can I assist you today?"_

## 2. Clarity & Structure

- **Be Specific**: Outline the main purpose, tone, and steps you want the AI to follow.
- **Use Examples**: Show sample dialogues. _"If the user says they have a billing question, ask them for their invoice number."_

## 3. Handling "Unknown" Cases

- If a user asks about something off-topic, decide whether the AI should:
  - Provide a default response: _"I'm not sure, let me transfer youâ€¦"_
  - Gather more details.

## 4. Keep It Short & Focused

- A short prompt often works best; too-long instructions can make the AI slower or prone to "hallucination."
- If you have lengthy content, consider a knowledge-base or chunk your text with headings.

**Tip:** Periodically review your transcripts to see where the AI might need more or fewer instructions.
