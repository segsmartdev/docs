Some common pitfalls when first configuring Otonistark.ai:

## 1. AI Not Responding or Call Dropping

- **Check the System Prompt**: Possibly missing instructions.
- **Voice Activity Detection**: If set too low or high, it may cause awkward silences or interruptions.
- **Connection**: If your internet or SIP trunk is unstable, calls might drop.

## 2. Not Receiving OTP (for Caller ID Verification)

- **Carrier Blocks**: Some operators filter out short codes or unknown international SMS.
- **Try Alternate Method**: Ask support if you can verify by a quick voice call or another phone line.

## 3. Credential Errors

- **SIP**: Wrong username/password? Double-check with your PBX provider.
- **API/Webhooks**: Ensure you copied the correct token or endpoint URL.

**Tip:** Look at call logs for error codes if a call fails. Usually, it'll show a reason like "Number not found" or "Network unreachable."
