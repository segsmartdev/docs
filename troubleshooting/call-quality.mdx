Call quality can be affected by both technical factors and AI settings. Here's how to optimize both:

## AI Engine Impact

Your choice of AI engine affects perceived call quality:

### Fast Engine + Filler Audio

- Minimal latency
- Quick back-and-forth
- Natural conversation flow
- Best for most calls

### Standard/Accurate Engine

- Longer processing time
- More accurate responses
- Better for complex conversations

## Optimization Tips

- Start with Fast Engine + Filler Audio
- Switch to Standard/Accurate only if needed
- Monitor call recordings for quality
- Test different voice models

## Quick Fixes

If experiencing issues:

1. Try a test call
2. Switch to a faster engine setting
3. Enable filler audio
4. Check network connection

**Tip:** The combination of Fast Engine and Filler Audio typically provides the best perceived call quality.
