## 1. Bring Your Own Number (SIP Integration)

- **Yes**: If you have a PBX or VOIP provider, you can integrate via SIP trunk.
- Inbound & outbound will flow through your existing lines, but still utilize Otonistark.ai's AI.

## 2. Caller ID Verification

- If you just want your existing number to show up for outbound calls, verify it as a **Caller ID**.
- This does not handle inbound calls, though, unless you do a SIP or direct port.

## 3. Twilio Account

- Direct Twilio account integration is on our roadmap or in early access for some enterprise clients.
- Meanwhile, you can have the best of both worlds by provisioning Twilio-based numbers through Otonistark.ai or using a custom approach.

**Note:** If you absolutely must connect your personal Twilio subaccount, contact support to check if you're eligible for the pilot program.
