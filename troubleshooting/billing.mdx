## 1. Unexpected Charges?

- **Large Outbound Campaign?** Possibly your calls used more minutes than expected.
- **Did You Rent Multiple Numbers?** Monthly fees stack if you keep multiple lines active.

## 2. Refund / Cancellation Policies

- Check your plan's terms. Usually usage-based minutes are non-refundable because resources are used in real-time.
- If you have a monthly plan with included minutes, you can often cancel future renewals but not partial months.

## 3. Tracking Usage

- **Dashboard**: Real-time usage counters show minutes consumed.
- **Notifications**: Set alerts if you near a monthly threshold.

**Tip:** If usage spiked unexpectedly, see call logs or see if an employee triggered a large campaign by mistake.
