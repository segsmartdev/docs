If you're experiencing issues with voice quality or response timing, you can adjust several settings to optimize performance.

## Response Speed vs. Accuracy

Your AI assistant has adjustable engine settings:

- **Fast Engine**: Quicker responses but might be less accurate
- **Standard Engine**: Balanced speed and accuracy
- **Accurate Engine**: Most accurate but slower responses

Adjust these in your assistant's settings under "AI Engine Configuration".

## Filler Audio

To minimize silence during processing:

- Enable "Filler Audio" in your assistant settings
- The AI will use natural sounds (like "hmm" or "one moment") while processing
- Works best with the Fast Engine for near-instant perceived responses

## Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Slow Responses**

   - Switch to Fast Engine mode
   - Enable Filler Audio
   - Simplify your system prompt

2. **Inaccurate Responses**

   - Use the Accurate Engine mode
   - Provide more context in your prompt
   - Add specific examples

3. **Voice Quality**
   - Try different voice models
   - Adjust speech speed settings
   - Try cloning a voice

## Optimization Tips

- For sales calls: Use Fast Engine + Filler Audio for natural flow
- For support: Consider Accurate Engine for better comprehension
