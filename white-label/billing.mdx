With White Label, you're in control of how your sub-clients pay:

## 1. Payment Gateway Integration

- **Stripe** is common, but other gateways may be supported.
- Link your gateway in the White Label admin panel, so your brand charges the end-user.

## 2. Setting Rates

- You can define your own per-minute cost, phone number rental price, or monthly subscription tier.
- The difference between what your clients pay and Otonistark.ai's wholesale rates is your profit.

## 3. Usage Tracking

- Each sub-account's minutes, phone numbers, and campaigns are tracked.
- The system automatically calculates monthly usage and potential overages.

## 4. Invoicing

- Typically, you handle invoices to your sub-clients.
- Otonistark.ai bills you for the wholesale usage. You then mark up and bill your clients.

**Note:** Keep an eye on high-usage sub-accounts to avoid unexpected bills. You can set usage caps or alerts to control risk.
