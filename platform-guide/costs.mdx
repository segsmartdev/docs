Costs are calculated based on your usage, and you have a wallet where 1 credit equals 1 minute of call time.

## Types of costs

There are two types of costs:

- **Otonistark costs**: These are the costs associated with the AI assistant handling the call
- **Carrier costs**: These are the costs associated with the carrier (telephone network) used to make the call

## Otonistark costs

This is a fixed cost of USD 0.20/call minute which is NOT rounded to the minute.
_Example: for a 30 seconds call duration, you will be billed only $0.10._

## Carrier costs

These costs are rounded to the next minute and depend on the country you are calling to. We do not add any markups on these costs as we use the same rates as the carriers themselves.

_Example: for a 30 seconds call to a number in the USA, you will be billed 1 minute x $0.01 = $0.01_
