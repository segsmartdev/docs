The first few seconds of a call are crucial - they determine whether the customer stays on the line. You have two options for your assistant's first greeting: text-based initial message or custom initial audio.

## Initial Message

This is the first thing your AI assistant says when starting a call. The message is read exactly as written, so:

### Best Practices

1. **Keep it Short**

   - Aim for 5-10 seconds
   - Get to the point quickly
   - Avoid long company introductions

2. **Write Exactly as Needed**

   - Include proper diacritics (é, ñ, ü, etc.)
   - Use punctuation for proper pausing
   - Write numbers as they should be spoken

3. **Example Formats**

   ```
   Good:
   "Hi! This is Sarah from ABC Company. How can I help you today?"

   Better with pausing:
   "Hi! This is Sarah from ABC Company... How can I help you today?"

   With diacritics:
   "¡Hola! Soy María de ABC Company. ¿Cómo puedo ayudarte?"
   ```

## Initial Audio

For the best first impression, you can use a pre-recorded audio file:

### Benefits

- Professional quality
- Perfect pronunciation
- Human warmth
- Consistent delivery
- Higher customer retention

### Setup Process

1. Record your greeting with a professional voice actor
2. Upload the audio file in assistant settings
3. Clone the same voice for the rest of the conversation
4. Enable initial audio playback

### Best Practices

1. **Recording Quality**

   - Use professional equipment
   - Record in a quiet environment
   - Maintain consistent volume
   - Save in high quality format

2. **Voice Matching**

   - Use the same voice actor for cloning
   - Maintain consistent tone and style
   - Match energy levels

3. **Content Guidelines**
   - Keep under 10 seconds
   - Include company name
   - State purpose clearly
   - Sound welcoming

### Example Script Structure

```
[Greeting] + [Company Name] + [Purpose/Question]

"Hello! This is ABC Company calling about your recent inquiry. How are you today?"
```

## Combining Both Methods

You can set up both:

- Initial audio as primary greeting
- Initial message as backup
- System will use audio when available

## Testing

Before going live:

1. Call your assistant
2. Listen for:
   - Clear pronunciation
   - Natural pauses
   - Proper volume
   - Smooth transition to AI conversation

## Language Considerations

- Each language needs its own initial message/audio
- Use native speakers for recordings
- Consider regional accents
- Test with target audience

**Pro Tip:** Record several versions of your initial audio and test which one gets better response rates.
