Otonistark.ai offers built-in "tools" that your AI assistant can use during a call. These help you shape the conversation flow and automate actions like transferring calls or scheduling appointments.

## 1. End Call Tool

- **Purpose**: Tells the AI to politely wrap up the conversation.
- **How It Works**: You can specify in the system prompt or logic, for instance: "If the user says `goodbye`, end the call."
- **Configuration**: In the assistant's settings, you can define any conditions that should trigger the end call.

## 2. Transfer Tool

- **Purpose**: Moves the caller from the AI assistant to a human agent or external phone number.
- **Use Cases**: Warm leads on a sales call, escalations on a support call, etc.
- **Settings**: In the assistant's config, add the phone number or department the call should go to, and optionally a short hold message.

## 3. Appointment Scheduler

- **Purpose**: Lets the AI check your calendar availability (e.g. via Cal.com or Google Calendar) and book an appointment.
- **Typical Flow**:
  1. AI offers scheduling.
  2. Caller selects date/time.
  3. AI confirms and sends a confirmation (using email or SMS if configured).

## 4. No-Code Automation Platform

- **Purpose**: After or during calls, the AI can trigger actions in the automation platform (like updating a CRM, sending an email, or logging results in Google Sheets).
- **Setup**: Link your assistant with the "Automation" tab, choose triggers ("Call Ended," "Customer Agrees," etc.), and pick the action (send a Slack notification or add a row in Sheets).

**Note:** Tools can be combined. For instance, the AI can schedule an appointment, then if the caller wants more info, it can transfer them to a human agent.
