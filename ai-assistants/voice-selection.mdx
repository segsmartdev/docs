Your AI assistant can speak with **built-in voices** or a **custom cloned voice**. Natural, realistic voices increase customer trust and engagement.

## 1. Built-In Voice Library

- **Powered by**: ElevenLabs.
- **Selection**: Choose male/female, accent, or language from our default list.
- **Customization**: Adjust pitch, speed, or filler usage if desired.

## 2. Cloning Your Own Voice

- **Why Clone?**: For brand consistency or a familiar voice to your audience.
- **Audio Sample Requirements**: Provide a clear audio recording (usually 1â€“5 minutes).
- **Process**:
  1. Record yourself reading a script (no background noise).
  2. Upload it in the "Clone Voice" section.
  3. Wait for training to complete (could be minutes or hours).
  4. Test the new voice with small sample texts.

## 3. Best Practices

1. **High-Quality Audio**: The clearer your sample, the better the cloned result.
2. **Steady Delivery**: Speak in a natural tone, avoid abrupt changes.
3. **Check for Legal**: Ensure you have permission to clone any voice if it's not yours.

**Tip:** After selecting or cloning a voice, always do a quick test call to confirm it sounds as expected.
