Ready to set up your first AI assistant? Follow these steps:

## 1. Go to "Assistants"

In your Otonistark.ai dashboard, find the **Assistants** page (sometimes labeled "AI Assistants" or similar).

## 2. Click "Create New Assistant"

- Choose **Inbound** if you want it to answer incoming calls.
- Choose **Outbound** if it's for campaigns calling out to leads/customers.

## 3. Fill Out Basic Info

- **Assistant Name**: Internal label, e.g. "Support Bot" or "Sales Bot."
- **System Prompt**: Outline the assistant's role, tone, and key instructions.
- **Initial Message**: The first line the AI will speak (inbound calls usually need a quick greeting).

## 4. Language & Voice

- Select a **Voice** from the built-in library, or pick a cloned voice if you've created one.
- (Optional) Configure speech speed, filler usage, or "voice activity detection" if you need specialized settings.

## 5. Tools & Functions

- Add or remove items like **transfer call**, **end call**, or **appointment scheduling** (more in [Tools & Functions](/ai-assistants/tools-and-functions)).

## 6. Save & Test

- Click **Save** and your assistant is ready!
- For inbound, you'll need to assign a phone number.
- For outbound, attach the assistant to a campaign or test with your own phone number.

## Editing an Assistant

- Return to **Assistants** in the dashboard.
- Click on the assistant name.
- Adjust prompts, voice, or add new toolsâ€”then **Save**.

**Tip:** Always test your changes by calling the assistant or running a small outbound campaign to confirm it behaves as expected.
