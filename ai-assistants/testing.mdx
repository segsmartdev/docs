There are two ways to test your AI assistant, depending on whether you want to test inbound or outbound functionality.

## Testing Outbound Calls

The fastest way to test your assistant's outbound capabilities:

1. Go to your assistant's settings
2. Find the "Make test call" purple button
3. Enter your phone number
4. Click to initiate the test
5. You'll receive a call from your AI assistant immediately

## Testing Inbound Calls

To test how your assistant handles incoming calls:

1. Make sure you have a phone number assigned to your assistant
2. Call that number from any phone
3. Your AI assistant will answer and handle the call

**Tip:** Save your AI's phone number in your contacts to easily make inbound test calls whenever needed.
