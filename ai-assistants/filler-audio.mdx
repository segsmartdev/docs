Filler audio adds natural conversation sounds (like "hmm" or "one moment") while your AI assistant processes responses. This creates a more human-like interaction by eliminating awkward silences.

## How It Works

When enabled, your AI assistant will:

- Use short audio fillers during processing time
- Maintain engagement while formulating responses
- Signal active listening to the caller

   - Eliminates dead air
   - Keeps callers engaged
   - Reduces hang-ups
   - Creates natural dialogue rhythm

2. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - More human-like interaction
   - Less awkward waiting
   - Better caller retention
   - Increased trust

## Setup

1. Go to your AI assistant settings
2. Find the "Filler Audio" option
3. Toggle it on
4. Save your changes
