An **AI Assistant** (sometimes called an agent) is your configurable bot that speaks with customers or leads over the phoneâ€”either when they call you (**inbound**) or when your system calls them (**outbound**).

## Why Use an AI Assistant?

- **Automate Common Interactions**: Answer FAQs, book appointments, or qualify leads 24/7.
- **Reduce Workload**: Free your human team from repetitive tasks like verifying contact info or taking messages.
- **Scalable**: One assistant can handle many calls in parallel, allowing you to grow without adding more agents.

## Key Components

1. **System Prompt**: The core instructions guiding how your assistant behaves.
2. **Initial Message**: The very first phrase the AI says (especially critical for inbound calls).
3. **Voice Settings**: Choose a built-in voice or clone your own.
4. **Tools** (Optional): Transfer, end call, scheduling, and more.
