While Otonistark.ai tries to keep billing straightforward, certain scenarios can incur extra fees:

1. **Premium or Special Numbers**

   - Some countries have special "golden" or vanity numbers that cost more monthly.
   - Toll-free lines might have per-minute surcharges for inbound calls.

2. **Advanced Languages**

   - Cloning a custom language model or adding a rare language may require a one-time setup fee.
   - Example: "We can add X language for \$49 if it's not in our default list."

3. **Bulk SMS or WhatsApp Integration**

   - If you add text-based notifications or confirmations, standard SMS rates or third-party WhatsApp fees may apply.

4. **Exceeding Plan Limits**

   - If your plan includes free minutes or campaigns, using more than allocated can lead to overage charges (pay-as-you-go rates).

5. **Regulatory / Compliance Charges**
   - Certain areas impose short-call surcharges, universal service fund fees, or e911 fees for VOIP solutions.
   - Usually small, but can appear on your invoice as separate line items.

**Tip:** Keep an eye on your monthly invoice breakdown for a transparent view of each item. If something is unclear, contact billing support to clarify.
