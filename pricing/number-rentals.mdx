Otonistark.ai offers multiple ways to handle phone numbers for inbound or outbound calls. You can **rent** a dedicated number from us, use a **SIP** trunk (no monthly fee but carrier costs are on your own PBX), or verify an **existing Caller ID** (also no monthly fee, but region-based per-minute charges).

## 1. Renting a Dedicated Number

If you want a fully managed inbound/outbound line, you can rent it directly in the platform:

- **Monthly Fee**: Typically \$3.99/month for standard local numbers (US/CA/UK). Regions vary:
  - **EU Countries**: €3–€5/month
  - **Latin America, Asia, Africa**: \$10+ in some cases, depending on availability or local taxes
- **Custom Provisioning**: If you don’t see your desired country or region listed, our team can custom-provision a number after verifying local documents.

**Per-Minute Rates**

- Outbound calls on a rented number: depends on the country you’re calling—could range from \$0.05/min to \$0.50/min if it’s an expensive destination.
- Inbound calls: usually no extra charge unless it’s a special/toll scenario in that region.

## 2. SIP Integration (No Monthly Fee)

If you already have a VOIP/PBX solution, you can integrate via a **SIP trunk** with **no monthly rental** from Otonistark.ai. Instead, you pay:

- **SIP Per-Minute**: \$0.00045/min on our side for carrier bridging. Your VOIP provider may also have separate usage fees.
- **Your Existing Number**: You’ll continue to use your own phone lines for inbound and outbound, but the carrier layer costs \$0.00045/min with us whenever the AI is on the call.

This is ideal if you’re comfortable managing your own phone system or want to keep your existing numbers without renting from us.

## 3. Caller ID (No Monthly Fee)

You can verify an existing number for **outbound calls** only—no inbound routing.

- **Verification**: We confirm ownership via a short OTP or call.
- **Per-Minute**: For the telephony used behind the scenes, we charge region-based rates.
  - **Example**: In the US, Caller ID usage might be \$0.01/min.
  - Other countries vary; contact support for specifics.

> **Note**: Caller ID alone does **not** enable inbound AI; it only masks your outbound calls with your verified number.

## 4. International Rates & Regions

When making outbound calls:

- **Carrier Rates**: Some countries cost \$0.01/min, others \$0.50/min due to local carriers.
- **Inbound**: If you rent a number in a high-cost region or special type, inbound calls could have surcharges.

Regardless of whether you rent a number or use Caller ID/SIP, the **carrier portion** of the call cost depends on the destination/origin country and is typically added to your overall usage.

## 5. Putting It All Together

1. **Rent a Number**
   - Pay a monthly fee (from \$3.99), plus standard inbound/outbound carrier costs for calls on that line.
2. **Use SIP**
   - No monthly from us, but a \$0.00045/min AI bridging cost, plus your own PBX fees.
3. **Caller ID**
   - No monthly from us, but region-based per-minute telephony charges (e.g., \$0.01/min in the US). Outbound only.
