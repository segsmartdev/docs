Here's a simplified comparison of inbound vs. outbound costs:

| **Cost Factor**         | **Inbound**                                       | **Outbound**                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phone Number            | Monthly rental for local or toll-free (if needed) | Optional; you can use a rented number or just verify Caller ID. |
| Per-Minute Charge       | For each minute the AI stays connected            | For each minute of dialing your leads; also includes ring time. |
| Additional Carrier Fees | Toll-free inbound can have surcharges             | Some international destinations can have higher outbound rates  |
| AI Processing           | Included in the per-minute rate                   | Included in the per-minute rate                                 |

**Inbound**

- Typically cheaper if customers are local.
- Might pay extra for "800" or toll-free lines.

**Outbound**

- Highly dependent on lead destination countries.
- Possibly more expensive if calling places with high telecom fees (some parts of Africa, for example).

**Note:** Always verify your calling region(s) to confirm cost details. If you see unexpected high charges, check if you're calling premium lines or remote areas.
