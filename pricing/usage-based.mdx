# Pricing Breakdown

Otonistark.ai uses a **minutes-based** system for billing. These minutes (or tokens/credits) get **deducted** from your balance each time you make or receive a call. The actual “per-minute cost” depends on your plan, and **carrier costs** are also converted into minutes. Below is how it works.

---

## 1. Inbound vs. Outbound Calls

- **Inbound**: You spend minutes as soon as the AI assistant picks up and is engaged in a call.
- **Outbound**: Minutes start deducting once the customer answers the call and stays connected. Dial time is not billed.

> **Note**: A call is considered active until the AI or the user hangs up, **or** until voicemail detection ends the call if the user’s voicemail answers (for outbound).

---

## 2. How Minutes Are Used

### a) AI Spoken Time

- If your AI assistant is actively on the call for 1 minute, you consume **1 minute** of AI time.
- The cost is **prorated** by the second, so a 30-second call uses 0.5 minutes from your plan (for AI time).

### b) Carrier Conversion

- **Carrier cost** (the telecom network fee) is also deducted from your balance **but** is typically **rounded up** to the next minute.
- We convert the carrier’s dollar amount to minutes at your plan’s rate.
  - **Example**: If your carrier charge is \$0.05 for a 1-minute call, and your plan’s AI rate is \$0.10/min, we convert that \$0.05 to 0.5 minutes from your balance.

**So a single 1-minute conversation might consume:**

- **1 AI minute** (for the assistant)
- **+ 0.5 “carrier minutes”** (converted from the carrier’s \$0.05 to half your AI cost).
- **= 1.5 minutes total** deducted from your plan balance.

## 3. Per-Second Billing vs. Rounding

1. **AI Time**

   - **Measured per second**, so 70 seconds is ~1.17 minutes of AI usage.
   - Deducted exactly from your plan’s minute balance.

2. **Carrier Time**
   - **Rounded to next full minute** for the network fee.
   - Then converted into a fraction of your AI plan cost to decide how many “minutes” to deduct from your credit balance.

## 4. Included Minutes & Top-Ups

- **Each Plan**: Usually includes a monthly allotment of minutes.
- **Using Up Minutes**: Once you exceed included minutes, you can **top up** your wallet with additional minutes at your plan’s rate.
- **No Rollover**: Unused minutes typically don’t roll over to the next month.

**Example**

> You’re on the **Starter Plan** with 200 included minutes:
>
> - If you make enough calls that total 180 AI minutes + carrier conversions = 180 used, you have 20 left this month.
> - Next month, you reset to 200. If you need 210 minutes, you pay for 10 extra minutes at your plan’s rate.

## 5. Volume Discounts or Tiers

- Plans vary (e.g., **Starter** at \$0.20/min, **Pro** at \$0.15/min, **Agency** at \$0.09/min).
- High-volume usage (like 50,000+ minutes/month) can often get **bulk discounts** by contacting sales.

## 6. Quick Usage Examples

### Example A (Outbound Call, Starter Plan)

- **AI Rate**: \$0.20/min
- **Call Duration**: 30 seconds → 0.5 AI minutes = \$0.10 AI cost.
- **Carrier**: \$0.01/min, but 30 seconds → 1 minute rounded up → \$0.01.
  - \$0.01 at your plan’s \$0.20 rate = 0.05 “plan minutes” used (Or if you do a simpler approach, \$0.01 / \$0.20 = 0.05 minutes)
- **Total**: 0.5 (AI) + 0.05 (carrier) = 0.55 minutes from your plan. If you had 200 included, you’d have 199.45 left.

### Example B (Inbound Call, Pro Plan)

- **AI Rate**: \$0.15/min
- **Call Duration**: 90 seconds → 1.5 AI minutes = \$0.225 AI cost.
- **Carrier**: Suppose inbound is \$0.015/min, rounding up to 2 minutes if the call was 1.5 min. That’s \$0.03 total.
  - \$0.03 / \$0.15 = 0.2 minutes from your plan.
- **Total**: 1.5 (AI) + 0.2 (carrier) = 1.7 minutes deducted.

### FAQ

- **Do I pay double if user + AI talk simultaneously?**  
  **No**, it’s based on total call duration, not per speaker concurrency.
- **What if someone picks up then instantly hangs up?**  
  The AI might register a few seconds; cost is fractional for the AI, but carrier may round up to 1 minute.

---

**Bottom Line**  
All calls burn **AI time** plus a **converted carrier cost** from your plan’s minute balance. Keep track of usage in your dashboard, top up if needed, and choose the plan that best suits your volume.
