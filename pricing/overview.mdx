Otonistark.ai uses a **credit/minute system** to track usage for both AI processing and carrier network fees. Here's how it breaks down:

---

## 1. Main Components

1. **AI Cost**

   - Billed in fractional increments by the second (e.g., 0.5 minute for a 30-sec call).
   - Rate depends on your plan (Starter, Pro, Agency, etc.).

2. **Carrier Cost**

   - The telecom side of the call, generally **rounded up** to the next minute and converted to your plan’s minute rate.
   - Region-dependent: e.g., calling US vs. Europe vs. Asia has different carrier rates.

3. **Number Rental**

   - If you rent a phone number, there’s a monthly fee (e.g., \$3.99 for a standard US number).
   - If your region isn’t listed, we can custom-provision a number upon verifying documents.
   - Each number’s cost is billed monthly until released.

4. **Extra Fees (Optional)**
   - **SMS**: If your number is SMS-capable, standard per-message fees apply.
   - **Voicemail detection**: Billed as 1 minute per call.
   - **High-Volume**: Potential bulk discounts if you exceed tens of thousands of minutes monthly.

## 2. Visual Example

Suppose you have 200 included minutes in your plan. A typical 1-minute call might consume ~1.5 minutes from your balance if carrier cost is half your plan’s rate. This means you’d have about 198.5 left. By the end of the billing cycle, any unused minutes do no rollover.

## 3. Checking Call Logs

- **Dashboard → Call History**: See each call’s final cost breakdown.
  - AI usage (seconds → fraction of a minute).
  - Carrier usage (rounded up → fraction of a minute after conversion).
  - Summed total in “minutes” deducted from your included or purchased balance.

## 4. Monitoring & Alerts

- Watch your real-time usage in the **dashboard**.

## 5. Putting It All Together

1. **Pick a Plan**: Decide on Starter, Pro, or Agency—higher plans have cheaper AI rates.
2. **Acquire or Verify a Number**: Rent from Otonistark.ai or add your own as caller ID for outbound.
3. **Start Making Calls**: Inbound or outbound usage deducts from your minute balance.
4. **SMS & Extras**: If relevant, each text or advanced feature also deducts from your balance or is billed separately.

That’s the overall cost structure. For a deeper look at the math behind minute conversion, check our [Pricing Breakdown](/pricing/usage-based) page.
