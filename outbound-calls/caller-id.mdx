When you launch an outbound campaign, you can choose which number appears on recipients' phones.

## 1. Dedicated Number

- If you've rented a local or toll-free number, you can select it as the "Phone number" in the assistant settings.
- Good for brand consistency or if you also accept inbound calls on the same line.
- **No OTP verification needed** for numbers rented through Otonistark.ai.

## 2. Verified Existing Number (Caller ID Only)

- If you want your personal or company phone line to appear, verify it with an **OTP** or short call.
- This won't handle inbound calls for the AI, but the lead sees that recognized number on caller ID.
- **Note**: OTP verification is ONLY required when using your own existing number as Caller ID.

## 3. SIP Integration

- If you use a PBX or VOIP platform, you might pass a custom caller ID from your existing system.
- Make sure your trunk or provider is set to allow a specific outbound Caller ID.

## 4. Country-Specific Rules

- Some regions prevent using numbers you don't own as Caller ID.
- Always ensure you have the right to present that number to avoid spam or legal issues.

**Tip:** Test by calling your own phone or a friendly colleague to confirm the correct caller ID is displayed before launching a big campaign.
