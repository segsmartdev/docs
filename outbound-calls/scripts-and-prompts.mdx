The power of outbound calling lies in having a clear, well-structured conversation flow. Here's how to craft an effective script.

## 1. System Prompt Best Practices

- **Introduce Your Company**: _"You are the Sales Bot for Ace Marketing…"_
- **Purpose**: _"…you offer a 20% discount if the user is interested, or schedule a callback if uncertain."_
- **Objection Handling**: _"…if they say 'no budget', attempt to collect a reason or set a reminder for next month."_

## 2. Example (Sales Prompt)

```plaintext
"You are the Sales Bot for ACME Corp. Greet politely, mention the new product launch, and offer a 10% discount if the lead is interested. If they ask for more info, invite them to schedule a call with a human agent. If they refuse or express disinterest, politely end the call."
```

## 3. Example (Collections Prompt)

```plaintext
"You are the Collections Bot for ABC Finance. Greet the user, verify their name and last payment date. If they confirm a willingness to pay, gather payment details or schedule a callback. If they refuse, politely note the reason and end the call."
```

## 4. Handling Yes/No/Maybe

- **Yes**: Provide details or transfer to a human for finalizing.
- **No**: Respectfully close, mark lead as not interested.
- **Maybe**: Offer to schedule a follow-up call or provide more info.

**Tip:** Keep your script short and direct. The AI can adapt, but a concise prompt helps keep calls focused and efficient.
