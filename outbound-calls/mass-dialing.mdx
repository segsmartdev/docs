One advantage of AI-driven outbound is that you can dial large batches of leads simultaneously without hiring more human agents.

## 1. Handling High-Volume Campaigns

- **Upload Thousands of Contacts**:
  - If your plan or usage limit allows, you can import big lists from CSV or integrate with your CRM.
- **Parallel Calls**:
  - A single phone number can handle multiple concurrent calls, but watch for compliance (some regions have rules against excessive cold calls).

## 2. Preventing Spam Flags

- **Reasonable Call Pace**:
  - Don't launch 10,000 calls instantly. Stagger them with short intervals to avoid spam detection or network blocks.
- **Caller ID Rotation** (Optional):
  - Some advanced users rotate caller IDs, but ensure they're all verified and within legal guidelines.

## 3. Real-Time Monitoring

- **Dashboard**:
  - See how many calls are active, success/no-answer rates, average call durations, etc.
- **Campaign Pause**:
  - If you spot unusual patterns (like high "no answer" or negative responses), pause the campaign to refine your script or lead quality.

**Note:** High-volume dialing may ramp up your minute usage quickly. Keep an eye on [Costs & Pricing](../../costs-and-pricing/cost-overview.md) to avoid surprises.
