An outbound "campaign" determines when, how, and to whom calls are made.

## 1. Setup a Campaign

1. **Go to Outbound / Campaigns** in your dashboard.
2. Click **Create New Campaign**:
   - **Name**: e.g. "January Promo," "Payment Reminder," etc.
   - **Assistant**: which AI assistant will handle these calls?
   - **Window**: choose the time window for the campaign

## 2. Importing Leads

- **CSV File**: Upload phone numbers (plus any extra columns, like name or account number).
- **Google Sheets**: Connect via the no-code platform or direct integration to pull leads.
- **CRM**: Some CRMs (HubSpot, GHL, etc.) can send leads directly to Otonistark.ai via API or automation.

## 3. Call Retries & Scheduling

- **Max Retries**: e.g., attempt each lead up to 2 times if they don't answer.
- **Retry Interval**: minutes/hours between retries.
- **Time Window**: e.g., only call between 9 AM and 6 PM local time to avoid inconveniencing leads.

## 4. Monitoring & Pausing

- Once the campaign is live, calls happen automatically during the allowed hours.
- You can **pause** or **stop** the campaign anytime to revise your script or leads list.

## 5. Analyzing Results

- Visit **Campaign Reports** to see:
  - How many calls were answered vs. no-answer.
  - Number of successful vs. failed calls.
  - Average call duration, etc.

**Note:** Large campaigns with thousands of leads can run concurrently, as AI can handle parallel calls. Watch your minute usage to avoid unexpected costs.
