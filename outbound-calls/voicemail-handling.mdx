When making outbound calls, the AI assistant can automatically detect if it has reached a voicemail or answering machine:

## Voicemail Detection

- The AI uses advanced detection to identify voicemail systems
- When voicemail is detected, the call is automatically ended
- This helps avoid wasting resources and ensures efficient call handling

## Benefits of Auto-Drop

- Saves time and call minutes
- Prevents awkward or incomplete interactions
- Allows for automatic retry scheduling
- Maintains professional communication standards

## Best Practices

- Monitor call logs to track voicemail rates
- Consider time zones when scheduling calls
- Plan retries during different hours
- Target business hours when people are more likely to answer

## Reporting

You can track voicemail detection in your campaign analytics:

- Number of detected voicemails
- Time of day patterns
- Success rates for different calling times

**Tip:** If you're getting too many voicemails, try adjusting your campaign's calling hours to when people are more likely to answer.
