Different countries have different rules about who can rent phone numbers and how calls are regulated. Here's what to watch for:

## 1. KYC (Know Your Customer)

- Some carriers require you to prove identity (passport/ID) or business ownership (business license).
- **Local Address**: May need a utility bill or tax document showing you have a presence in that country.

## 2. Telemarketing Rules

- **Consent**: Many regions require leads to have opted in to receive calls.
- **Do Not Call (DNC) Lists**: In the US, ensure you don't cold-call people who are on the national DNC registry.
- **Time Restrictions**: Some places restrict calling outside 8 AM to 9 PM local time.

## 3. Privacy & Recording

- If you record calls or transcribe them, comply with local laws. Some jurisdictions need two-party consent.
- Post disclaimers in your system prompt if required (e.g., "This call may be recorded or transcribed for quality purposes.").

**Note:** Violating telecom or privacy laws can lead to heavy fines. Always review local regulations before launching large-scale campaigns.
