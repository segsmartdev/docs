After you meet any compliance requirements and purchase or provision your numbers:

1. **View All Numbers**

   - In your dashboard â†’ **Numbers**. You'll see monthly costs, expiration/renewal dates, etc.

2. **Releasing or Renewing**

   - Release a number if you no longer need it.
   - Renewals happen automatically each month unless you release it.

3. **Scaling Up**
   - If you need multiple lines for different markets, repeat the provisioning steps.
