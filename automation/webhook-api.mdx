If you want deeper customization beyond no-code blocks, Otonistark.ai supports **webhooks** and a **REST API**.

## 1. Webhooks

- **When to Use**: Trigger events in external systems the moment something happens in Otonistark.ai (e.g., "Call Ended,").
- **Configuration**: Set a webhook URL in your assistant/campaign settings or the automation platform.
- **Payload**: Typically includes call ID, transcript, call outcome, or any user data collected.

## 2. REST API

- **Key Functions**:

  1. **Create/Update Leads**
  2. **Manage Campaigns**

- **Auth & Rate Limits**: Usually uses API tokens. Check [API docs](/api-reference/introduction) for details on endpoints and usage quotas.

## 3. Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time CRM Sync**: For each new call, post data to your CRM's endpoint.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Pull call data into your own analytics dashboard.

**Note:** You'll find the official API reference in a dedicated docs section or via your Otonistark.ai dashboard. Always secure your tokens and test endpoints in a dev environment.
