Otonistark.ai includes an internal automation engine (similar to Zapier or Make) that lets you build flows—no coding required. For instance:

1. **Trigger**: A call ends.
2. **Action**: A Slack notification is sent with call outcome and transcript.

## Key Concepts

- **Triggers**: Events inside Otonistark.ai (e.g., "call ended," "inbound call context injection").
- **Actions**: Steps that happen in response (e.g., "send email," "update Google Sheets," "webhook to CRM").

## Common Use Cases

- **Post-Call Data Handling**: Log transcripts in a database or notify your team of new leads.
- **Lead Import**: Automatically fetch new leads from a Google Sheet or CRM into an outbound campaign.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Once a caller confirms a time with the AI, you create or update a calendar event.

## Setting Up a Workflow

1. Go to **Automations** in your dashboard.
2. Click **Create Workflow**.
3. Pick a **trigger** (like "Call Ended") and select the **assistant**.
4. Add **actions** (like "Send Email to Team," "Add Row in Sheets," etc.).
5. Test and monitor logs to ensure everything runs smoothly.

**Tip:** Keep your workflows simple at first. Complex logic is possible, but it's best to start with a single trigger → single action until you get comfortable.
