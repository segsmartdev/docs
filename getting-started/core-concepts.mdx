Welcome to the fundamentals of Otonistark.ai. Here, we explore the essential building blocks that you need to understand before configuring your AI assistant and calls.

## 1. System Prompt & Initial Message

**System Prompt**

- The "brain" of your AI assistant. You write a short (or long) set of instructions that guide the assistant's behavior and tone of voice.
- This includes any important business info, disclaimers, or how you want the AI to handle edge cases.
- For example: _"You are a helpful phone assistant for XYZ Company, you greet in a friendly manner, confirm the caller's info, etc."_

**Initial Message**

- The very first thing the AI says.
- Typically short, like "Hello, thanks for calling XYZ Company!"

## 2. Voices

- Otonistark.ai integrates with **ElevenLabs** voices for natural-sounding speech.
- You can **clone** your own voice by providing audio samples or pick from built-in voices.
- Each voice can have adjustable parameters like speech speed, filler usage, or accent (if available).

## 3. Putting It All Together

- An **AI Assistant** is built by combining a system prompt, an initial message, and a chosen voice.
- Optionally, you add tools (like "transfer call" or "end call").
- Once the assistant is set, you assign it to a phone number (for inbound) or a campaign (for outbound).
