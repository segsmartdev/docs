Otonistark.ai operates on a **usage-based** model. You pay primarily for two things:

1. The **minutes** your AI spends in calls.
2. Any **dedicated phone number** rentals.

## 1. Included Minutes vs. Pay-as-You-Go

- **Included Minutes**: Some plans may come with a set of monthly minutes. These are consumed first.
- **Pay-as-You-Go**: If you exceed included minutes (or if you're on a usage-based plan), you pay for each additional minute used.

## 2. How We Calculate Minutes

- **Per-Second Billing**: Typically, Otonistark.ai bills by the second (converted to minutes). For example, a 90-second call is 1.5 minutes.
- **Rounding**: Make sure you check your plan's rounding rules. Some might round up to the nearest 30 seconds, while others do pure per-second.

## 3. Monthly Usage & Purchasing Extra

- **Monthly Reset**: If your plan includes minutes, those reset monthly on your billing date.
- **Buying Add-Ons**: You can purchase extra minute bundles if you expect a spike in call volume.

## 4. Additional Costs

- **Phone Number Rental**: A monthly fee for each dedicated inbound/outbound number you rent (varies by region).
- **Possible Carrier Surcharges**: Some countries may have unique taxes or surchargesâ€”check the [Costs & Pricing](../../costs-and-pricing/cost-overview.md) section for more details.

## 5. Monitoring Usage

- **Dashboard**: The platform displays your current usage, how many minutes are left, and your estimated cost so far.
- **Notifications**: You can set up alerts (e.g., "Email me when I hit 80% of monthly minutes") using the no-code automation platform.

**Next Steps**

- Check out our [Costs & Pricing](../../costs-and-pricing/cost-overview.md) section for a deeper breakdown of number rentals, international rates, inbound vs. outbound cost differences, and more.
