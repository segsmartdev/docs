Phone number rental fees vary based on country, number type, and local telecom rules. Below is a general guide:

## 1. Typical Monthly Costs

- **US/Canada**: Around \$3.99/month.
- **UK**: Typically ~£3/month, but can vary.
- **EU Countries**: €3–€5/month, or more for toll-free lines.
- **Others**: Some countries can be \$3 or more, depending on local taxes.

## 2. Advanced Documentation

- **Business Registration**: Many countries (e.g., France, Germany, Italy) require a local address or company registration to rent a number.
- **ID Proof**: Some carriers need a government-issued ID for individuals.

## 3. Additional Fees

- Some toll-free lines or special region numbers have higher monthly costs or per-minute surcharges.
- Calls to or from certain regions might also incur higher usage rates—see [Costs & Pricing](/pricing/overview) for full details.
