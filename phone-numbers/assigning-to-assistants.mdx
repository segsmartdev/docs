After you've acquired a number (or configured SIP or Caller ID), you'll need to assign it to your AI assistant. The process is the same whether you're using the number for inbound or outbound calls.

## Assigning a Number

1. Go to **Assistants** → **(Your Assistant)** → **Settings**
2. Under **Phone Numbers**, select a number from your Otonistark.ai inventory
3. Click **Save** to apply the changes

## Number Usage

Once assigned, the number can be used for:

- **Inbound**: Callers dialing this number will reach your AI assistant
- **Outbound**: The number will appear as Caller ID for outbound campaigns
- **Both**: The same number can handle both inbound and outbound calls

## Number Verification

For numbers not rented from Otonistark.ai:

- You'll need to verify ownership via **OTP code** or a **verification call**
- Once verified, the number can be used for both inbound and outbound
- Verification status persists across different assistants

## Testing

Before going live:

1. Make an inbound test call to verify the assistant answers
2. Run a test outbound call to check Caller ID display
3. Verify any specific features (call transfers, voicemail, etc.)

**Tip:** Always test both inbound and outbound functionality after making any changes to number assignments.
