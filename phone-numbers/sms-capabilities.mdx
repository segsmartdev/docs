## Requirements

To send SMS messages, you need:

- An SMS-capable phone number
- Sufficient credits in your account
- Proper automation flow setup

## SMS Segments

SMS messages are split into segments:

- Each segment is 160 characters for standard ASCII text
- Or 70 characters for Unicode (special characters, emojis)
- Longer messages are automatically split into multiple segments
- You are charged per segment sent

For example:

- "Hello! How are you?" (16 chars) = 1 segment
- A message with 200 ASCII chars = 2 segments
- A message with emojis and 100 chars = 2 segments

## Costs

SMS pricing varies by:

- Destination country
- Number of segments
- Type of content (standard/unicode)

## Monitoring & History

Track your SMS activity in the dashboard:

- Delivery status
- Timestamp
- Number of segments
- Cost per message
- Recipient details
- Content preview
