## 1. SMS Actions

- Send confirmation messages after calls
- Deliver follow-up information or links
- Send appointment reminders
- Provide quick updates or notifications

## 2. Configuration

1. Ensure your phone number is SMS-capable
2. Use the "Send SMS" action in your automation flow
3. Configure message template and variables
4. Set up triggers (e.g., after call completion)

## 3. Best Practices

- Keep messages concise and professional
- Include opt-out instructions if required by local laws
- Test SMS delivery before large campaigns
- Monitor delivery rates and costs

**Note:** SMS capability depends on your phone number's region and type. Contact support to confirm if your number supports texting.
