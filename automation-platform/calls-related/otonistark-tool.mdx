# Otonistark Tool

The Otonistark tool is the core component that connects your AI calling system with automation flows. It enables real-time data exchange between your AI assistants and business systems, allowing for personalized conversations and automated follow-ups.

<Note>
  You can find the Otonistark tool prominently displayed at the top of the

3. Configure variable mapping

### Inbound Call Variable Injection

This powerful trigger activates before your AI assistant picks up an inbound call, allowing you to:

- Fetch and inject real-time customer data
- Customize AI behavior based on context
