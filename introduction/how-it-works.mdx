Otonistark.ai blends **AI voice recognition** with **LLM-based replies** to conduct live phone conversations. Below is a simplified flow:

1. **Caller or Lead is Dialed**

   - **Inbound**: A customer dials your assigned phone number.
   - **Outbound**: Otonistark.ai's system calls a list of phone numbers from your campaign.

2. **Speech Recognition**  
   The AI listens to what the person says and transcribes it into text in real time.

3. **LLM Decision**  
   Otonistark.ai uses a large language model (LLM) and your configured "system prompt" to craft a reply or decide the next action (like transferring the call).

4. **Voice Output**  
   The AI's response is converted to natural-sounding speech via our voice engine (ElevenLabs voices).

5. **Result & Actions**

   - For **Inbound**: The AI may answer questions, verify info, or take a message.
   - For **Outbound**: The AI can pitch a product, qualify leads, or transfer interested callers to a human agent.

6. **Data & Reporting**  
   You get transcripts, call recordings, call outcomes (like "no answer" or "success"), and the ability to automate follow-up actions.

## Distinctions: Inbound vs. Outbound

- **Inbound**

  - Caller dials a number you rented or integrated.
  - AI picks up, greets, and handles queries or routes the caller if needed.

- **Outbound**
  - You upload or sync leads.
  - AI dials each number, follows your call script, possibly transfers if the lead is interested.
